        <h1>Burgle Review</h1>
        <p><strong>Published:</strong> April 19, 2025</p>
        <p>CineNerdle</p>
        <p>Burgle is a movie guessing game where the player tries to identify films whose descriptions contain keywords from a list that is unique to that day‚Äôs puzzle. To win in as few guesses as possible you try to think of a movie which has obvious connections to as many of the keywords as possible. This is another game made by Cine2nerdle who also produce three more daily movie games, a catalog of user generated games, and an only player-vs-player game based on linking movies by their cast. The daily burgle is a refreshing take on movie games as the format allows the player to guess only movies they know and still work towards completing the game, making it highly accessible to even non-cinephiles.</p>

        <p>In the game the player is given a list of nine keywords that appear in the description of an unknown movie. The player then guesses movies and checks off keywords as they appear in the descriptions of the guessed films (e.g. if the player guesses ‚ÄúFinding Nemo‚Äù that may check off keywords like ‚ÄúJourney‚Äù and ‚ÄúFatherhood‚Äù even if the movie from which those keywords were drawn was Interstellar). The player has seven guesses to satisfy all nine keywords or as many as they can, with it always being possible to get all nine in just one attempt by guessing the original film, an unlikely achievement for myself, but probably in the realm of possibility for a real movie buff.</p>

        <p>The game‚Äôs core mechanic stands out against other movie-based daily games in how it forces the player to engage with more abstract themes and motifs that connect films instead of calling on one's ability to remember semantic details like cast lists, release years, or box office returns. This mechanic makes the game both accessible to non-experts, as you will never need specific knowledge of any one film to play, and a unique challenge to aficionados who can strive for very low scores. Like many daily games, this website has a modern, minimalist aesthetic and worked well on both desktop and mobile.</p>

        <p>My main frustrations with this game are two-fold: 1. Sometimes the filter that determines if you should get credit for finding a keyword is overly generous. For example, in a previous game I guessed ‚ÄúKingsman: the Secret Service ‚Äù and was awarded the keyword ‚Äúchest‚Äù because a character in that film has the name Chester. This is probably better than the alternative of the filter being overly restrictive, but it still feels a bit janky and undeserved. However, small mercies like this are appreciated when considering my second critique of the game. 2. In my experience, Burgle is very hard, and trying to ‚Äúburgle‚Äù all nine keywords requires serious thought and perseverance, even with all seven attempts. Trying to do well in this game requires more time and effort than most other daily games, which may be a rewarding challenge for some, but for me feels like a departure from the fast, casual experience I‚Äôve come to love in the daily game category.</p>

        <p><strong>Burgle is a slow paced movie game with a common, but sleek and professional look, whose accessible and completely unique core mechanic sets it apart from other games in its category. 4/5 - Above average</strong></p>
